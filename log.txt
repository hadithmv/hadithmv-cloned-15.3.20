ToDos:
make nav bar, responsive and drawer with icons and tabs
get auto json to array set up

Issues:
copy bad for both select keytable and clipboard button

align and resize input and buttons

Using 'current' instead of 'visible' does allow the copy to clipboard function to work on card view, however it would copy cells hidden by colvis.
card view breaks copy to clipboard for visible
