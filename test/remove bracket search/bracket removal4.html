  ["[Tiger] Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah al-Ansari (while talking about the period of pause in Revelation) reporting from the Prophet as saying: While I was walking, (suddenly) I heard a voice from the sky. So I looked up and saw the angel (Jibril) who came to me at the cave of Hira, he was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I became afraid of him, so I returned home and said: Wrap me (in blankets). And then Allah the Most High revealed: \"O you (Muhammad) wrapped up in blankets, arise and warn, and proclaim the Greatness of your Rabb, and purify your garments, and shun the idols.\" [Mudhathir 74:1-5] Afterwards, the Revelation started coming strongly, frequently and regularly.","System Architect","Edinburgh","61","2011/04/25","$3,120"  ],
