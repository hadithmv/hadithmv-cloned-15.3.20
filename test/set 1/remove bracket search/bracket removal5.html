So he whose migration (hijra) was for some worldly matter that he might gain, or for a woman he might marry, then his migration is for whatever it is he migrated to.","Takhrij: Bukhari 0054, 2529, 3898, 5070, 6689, 6953"  ],

And sometimes the Angel (Jibril) appears to me in the form of a man and speaks to me, then I grasp what he says. -Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) said: And indeed, I have seen him ﷺ being sent Revelation on a very cold day, and when it was over, his forehead would surely drip sweat-","Takhrij: Bukhari 2661, 3215, 4141, 4750"  ],

[Nisa 4:163]","Narrated Aisha, the Mother of the Believers: The start of Revelation to Allah's Messenger ﷺ began in the form of good dreams in his sleep, and so it came to be that he did not see a dream except that came true like the dawn, and then solitude was made beloved to him. And he used to seclude himself in the cave of Hira where he worshipped (Allah alone) for many nights before he left to go back to his family. And he used to take food supplies for the stay (in the cave), and he would then come back to (his wife) Khadija, and he would take food supplies likewise again. Until the Truth came to him while he was in the cave of Hira. Thus the angel (Jibril) came to him and said: Read. The Prophet said: I don't know how to read. (The Prophet added:) Then the angel held me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard until I could bear it no longer. He then released me and said: Read. I said: I do not know how to read. Then he held me and pressed me a second time until I could bear it no longer. He then released me and said: Read. I said: I do not know how to read. Then he held me and pressed me a third time until I could bear it no longer. He then released me and said: \"Read, in the Name of your Rabb who created (All that exists). Who created man from a (clinging) clot (of blood). Read, and your Rabb is the Most Generous.\" (Alaq 96:1-3). So Allah's Messenger ﷺ returned with it (the Revelation) while his heart was pounding. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said: Cover me, cover me (with a blanket). So they covered him until his fear had gone. Then he told Khadija what had happened and said: I surely feared for my life. So Khadija said: Never. By Allah, Allah would never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your relatives, help the poor and needy, serve guests generously and you help the truly destitue. Khadija then went with him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who was a man who converted to christianity during the Jahiliyya (Pre-Islamic period) during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian. He used to write in Hebrew, and so he would write from the Injil (Gospel) in Hebrew as much as Allah willed him to write. And he was an old man who had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa: O my cousin, listen to your nephew. Waraqa asked: O my nephew, what have you seen? And so Allah's Messenger ﷺ told him what he had seen. Waraqa said: This is the Naamoos (angel Gabriel) that Allah had sent to Musa ﷺ. O if only I were young during that time. O if only I could be alive when your people would  drive you out. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said: Would they drive me out? Waraqa said: Yes, never has a man came with the like which you have brought, except that he was treated with animosity, and if I were to reach your days (when you would be driven out) I would support you with a strong support. But Waraqa did live long after that and died, and Revelation stopped (paused for a while).",""  ],

[Nisa 4:163]","Abdullah bin Abbas narrated from Abu Sufyan bin Harb: Heraclius (the Ceasar, christian king of Rome) had sent for him (Abu Sufyan) while he was accompanying a trade caravan from Quraish. They were trading in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan), at the time when Allah's Messenger ﷺ had a truce with Abu Sufyan and disbelievers of Quraish. So Abu Sufyan and his companions came to Heraclius at Eeliya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them to his court and he had noblemen of Rome around him. Then he called for his translator and said to them: Which of you is most closely related to this man who claims to be a Prophet? Abu Sufyan said: I am the nearest relative to him from them. Heraclius said: Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me, bring his companions and keep them behind him. Then Heraclius told his translator: Tell them, that I am about to question this one (Abu Sufyan) about that man (Muhammad), so if he lies, then contradict him. (Abu Sufyan said:) By Allah, were it not for the embarrassment that they would report me lying, I would have surely lied upon him. So the first thing he asked me about him was: What is his lineage among you? I said: He belongs to a noble lineage among us. Heraclius asked: Has anyone among you ever made this claim (of Prophethood) before him? I replied: No. He said: Was anyone among his ancestors a king? I replied: No. He asked: Does the nobility of the people follow him or their poor? I replied: Rather, their poor. He said: Are his followers increasing or decreasing? I replied: Rather, they are increasing. He asked: Then from them, does anyone leave his religion out of displeasure after having entered it? I replied: No. He said: Have you ever accused him of lying before he said what he said? I replied: No. He said: Does he betray? I replied: No. And we are at a truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it. (Abu Sufyan said:) And I was not able to put in a word against him except that. Heraclius asked: Have you battled him? I replied: Yes. He said: So how your battle with him? I replied: The war between him us an him takes turns, sometimes he wins and sometimes we win. Heraclius said: What does he order you to do? I said: He tells us to worship Allah alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and to leave what your ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, and be honest, be chaste and to keep family relations. Then Heraclius said to the translator: Tell him (Abu Sufyan), I asked you about his lineage and you said he belonged to a noble lineage. Likewise, the Messengers are sent from the noble lineages of their people. Then I asked whether any among you had ever made this claim (of Prophethood), and you said no. Had anyone ever made this claim before, I would have said,  this is merely a man following something that was said before him. Then I asked whether anyone of his ancestors was a king, and you said no. Had there been a king from among his ancestors then I would have said, this is merely a man after the kingdom of his forefathers. Then I asked whether he was ever accused of lying before he said what he said, and said no. And I surely know that would not leave lying upon the people and lie upon Allah. Then I asked whether the nobility of the people followed him or their poor, and you said, their poor. And it is they who follow the Messengers. Then I asked whether his followers were increasing or decreasing, and you said they were increasing. And such is the matter of Iman (faith), until it is complete. Then I asked whether anyone leaves his religion out of displeasure after having entered it, and you said no. Such is Iman (faith) when it's happiness mixes with the heart. Then I asked whether he betrays, and you said no. Likewise the Messengers do not betray. Then I asked what he orders you to do, and you said he orders you to worship Allah alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and he forbids you from worshipping idols, and orders you to pray, be honest, and be chaste. And if what you say is true, then he will soon possess the very place beneath my feet. And indeed I knew (from the Scriptures) that he was about to appear, but I did not think he would be from among you. And if only I knew I could reach him, I would surely take it up on myself to go out and meet him. And if I were with him, I would surely wash his feet. Then Heraclius called for the letter of the Allah's Messenger ﷺ, which was sent with Dihya (a companion of Muhammad) to the head of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius. And written in it was:  In the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Especially Merciful, from Muhammad the Slave of Allah and His Messenger, to Heraclius, ruler of Rome. Peace be upon he who follows the guidance. As for what follows, indeed I call you with the invitation of Islam. Become Muslim, you will be saved. Allah will give you your reward twice over. And if you turn away, then upon you is the sin of (misguiding) your peasants. And (the saying of Allah:) \"O people of the Scripture, come to a common agreeable word between us and you, that we will worship none but Allah alone, and we will not worship anything along with Him, and some of us will not take others among us as Rabbs (Gods) instead of Allah. So if they turn away, then say, bear witness that we are indeed Muslims.\" [Aal Imran 3:64] Abu Sufyan said: Then when he had said what he had said and finished reading the letter, commotion increased near him and voices were raised, and we were turned out. So I said to my companions: Indeed, the matter of ibn Abi Kabsha (Allah's Messenger) has become a big deal. Indeed, the king of the white people fears him. And I never ceased to be sure that he ﷺ would soon be victorious until Allah entered Islam upon me. (The sub narrator adds:) Ibn an-Nazur was the head of Eeliya (Jerusalem), and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. He (Ibn an-Nazur) narrates that when Heraclius approached Eeliya, he woke up one day in a bad mood. So some of his priests said: We find your state displeasing. Ibn an-Nazur said: And Heraclius was a fortune teller, he used to look at the stars (astrology). So he replied to the priests saying: Indeed, when I looked at the stars at night, I saw that the king of the ones who are circumcized had appeared (became victorious). So who circumcizes among the nations? They said: None circumcizes except the jews, so do not let their affair concern you. And write to the towns of your kingdom, and they will kill whatever jews there are within them. So while they were in that discussion, Heraclius was brought a man that had been sent by the king of Ghassan, the man had brought news of Allah's Messenger ﷺ. Having heard his news, Heraclius said: Go and see whether the man (who had brought the news) is circumcized or not. So they looked at him, and told Heraclius that he was indeed circumcized. Then Heraclius asked him about the Arabs, so he said: they circumcize. So Heraclius said: This is the king of this nation that has indeed appeared. Then Heraclius wrote a letter to his companion in Rome, who was an equal to him in knowledge. And Heraclius left for Homs (a town in Syria), and he did not leave Homs until a letter from his companion had reached him, agreeing with Heraclius' opinion that the Prophet ﷺ had appeared, and that he was indeed a prophet. So Heraclius assembled the heads of Rome in a castle of his in Homs, and then ordered that its doors be closed, so they were shut. Then he appeared before them and said: O assembly of Romans, do you wish for success and guidance and that your kingdom remains? Then follow this Prophet. So the people scampered to the doors like zebras, but found they had been shut closed. So when Heraclius saw their hatred (of Islam), and lost hope of (them) believing, he said: Bring them back to me. And he said: Indeed, I said what I said just now as a test to see how strongly you are upon your religion, and now I know. So they prostrated to him and were pleased with him. And that was the end this story about Heraclious (and his calling to the faith of Islam).","Takhrij: Bukhari 51, 2681, 2804, 2941, 2978, 3174, 4553, 5980, 6260, 7196, 7541"  ],
