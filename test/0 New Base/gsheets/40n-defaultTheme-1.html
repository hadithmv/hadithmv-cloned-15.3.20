        "data": data,   //Data to use as the display data for the table. DataTables can obtain the data it is to display in the table's body from a number of sources, including being passed in as an array of row data using this initialisation parameter. As with other dynamic data sources, arrays or objects can be used for the data source for each row
        "columns": columns,     //Define details about the way individual columns behave.

//OPTIONS - DataTables and its extensions are extremely configurable libraries and almost every aspect of the enhancements they make to HTML tables can be customised. Features can be enabled, disabled or customised to meet your exact needs for your table implementations. Customisation of these options are performed by defining options in the $().DataTable() constructor - https://datatables.net/reference/option/

        "autoWidth": false,     //Automatic column width calculation. This can be disabled as an optimisation (it takes a finite amount of time to calculate the widths). Default: true.
        "deferRender": true,    //By default, when DataTables loads data from an Ajax or Javascript data source (ajax and data respectively) it will create all HTML elements needed up-front. When working with large data sets, this operation can take a not-insignificant amount of time, particularly in older browsers such as IE6-8. This option allows DataTables to create the nodes (rows and cells in the table body) only when they are needed for a draw. As an example to help illustrate this, if you load a data set with 10,000 rows, but a paging display length of only 10 records, rather than create all 10,000 rows, when deferred rendering is enabled, DataTables will create only 10. When the end user then sorts, pages or filters the data the rows needed for the next display will be created automatically. This effectively spreads the load of creating the rows across the life time of the page.
        "processing": true,     //Display a 'processing' indicator when the table is being processed (e.g. a sort). This is particularly useful for tables with large amounts of data where it can take a noticeable amount of time to sort the entries. Default: false. DOESNT SHOW??
        "ordering": true,   //Default: true == ordering of columns - DataTables, by default, allows end users to click on the header cell for each column, ordering the table by the data in that column. The ability to order data can be disabled using this option.
        /*"order": [ [0, "asc"] ],*/    //Default: [[0, 'asc']] orders by columns one, in acsending.
        "stateSave": false,     //DOESNT WORK WITH JSON FETCHED FROM GSHEETS, SO TURNED OFF HERE, OTHERWISE GOOD TO USE     -restore table state on page reload. When enabled aDataTables will store state information such as pagination position, display length, filtering and sorting. When the end user reloads the page the table's state will be altered to match what they had previously set up.
        /*"stateDuration": 60 * 60 * 24,*/  //Set state duration to 1 day. Use with above.  Default Value: 7200. Duration for which the saved state information is considered valid. After this period has elapsed the state will be returned to the default.

        "dom":
        /*before use with flexbox to make double row single. CSS above html.
                "<'row'<lfrip>>" +
                "<'row'<t>>" ,
        */
                "<'row'<'flex-container'<l><f><r><i><p>>>" +
                "<'row'<t>>" ,
        //Default Value: lfrtip ie: "<'row'<lfrtip>>"  Results in: <div class="wrapper"> {length} {processing} {table} {information} {pagination} </div> */     https://datatables.net/reference/option/dom   Define the table control elements to appear on the page and in what order. DataTables will add a number of elements around the table to both control the table and show additional information about it. The position of these elements on screen are controlled by a combination of their order in the document (DOM) and the CSS applied to the elements. This parameter is used to control their ordering and additional mark-up surrounding them in the DOM. Each table control element in DataTables has a single letter associated with it, and that letter it used in this dom configuration option to indicate where that element will appear in the document order.                                                      The built-in table control elements in DataTables are: l - length changing input control f - filtering input t - The table! i - Table information summary p - pagination control r - processing display element. Each option can be specified multiple times (with the exception of the table itself), which can be used to have table controls both above and below the table. DataTables will automatically synchronise these multiple controls. Markup: Further to these options, you can also specify additional div elements to be inserted into the document, which can be used for styling / nesting of the control elements.                          To add tags, the following syntax is expected: < and > - div element <"class" and > - div with a class <"#id" and > - div with an ID <"#id.class" and > - div with an ID and a class. Plug-ins DataTables feature plug-ins can be developed to add additional features to DataTables and often will make use of this option, adding new letters to the DataTables core features. For example Buttons adds the B option to dom to specify where table control buttons should be inserted into the table. The following extensions can be initialised through the dom option: B - Buttons S - Select

        "lengthMenu": [ [5, 10, 20, 30, 40, -1, 1], [5, 10, 20, 30, 40, "All", 1] ],     //https://datatables.net/reference/option/lengthMenu   Default [ 10, 25, 50, 100 ]     Change the options in the page length select list. This parameter allows you to readily specify the entries in the length drop down select list that DataTables shows when pagination is enabled. It can be either: 1D array of integer values which will be used for both the displayed option and the value to use for the display length, or 2D array which will use the first inner array as the page length values and the second inner array as the displayed options. This is useful for language strings such as 'All'). The page length values must always be integer values > 0, with the sole exception of -1. When -1 is used as a value this tells DataTables to disable pagination (i.e. display all rows).
        "orderClasses": false,      //Highlight the columns being ordered in the table's body. DataTables highlight the columns which are used to order the content in the table's body by adding a class to the cells in that column, which in turn has CSS applied to those classes to highlight those cells. This is done by the addition of the classes sorting_1, sorting_2 and sorting_3 to the columns which are currently being ordered on. The integer value indicates the level of sorting when mutli-column sorting. If more than 3 columns are being ordered upon, the sorting_3 class is repeated. Please note that this feature can affect performance, particularly in old browsers and when there are a lot of rows to be displayed as it is manipulating a large number of DOM elements. As such, this option is available as a feature switch to allow this feature to be disabled with working with old browsers or large data sets.
        "pagingType": "full_numbers",   //Default Value: simple_numbers         Pagination button display options. The pagination option of DataTables will display a pagination control below the table (by default, its position can be changed using dom and CSS) with buttons that the end user can use to navigate the pages of the table. Which buttons are shown in the pagination control are defined by the option given here.               DataTables has six built-in paging button arrangements: numbers - Page number buttons only (1.10.8) simple - 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons only simple_numbers - 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons, plus page numbers full - 'First', 'Previous', 'Next' and 'Last' buttons full_numbers - 'First', 'Previous', 'Next' and 'Last' buttons, plus page numbers first_last_numbers - 'First' and 'Last' buttons, plus page numbers.
        "searchDelay": 350,     //Default Value: null       Set a throttle frequency for searching. The built-in DataTables global search (by default at the top right of every DataTable) will instantly search the table on every keypress when in client-side processing mode and reduce the search call frequency automatically to 400mS when in server-side processing mode. This call frequency (throttling) can be controlled using the searchDelay parameter for both client-side and server-side processing. Being able to control the call frequency has a number of uses: Older browsers and slower computers can have their processing load reduced by reducing the search frequency Fewer table redraws while searching can be less distracting for the user Reduce the load on the server when using server-side processing by making fewer calls Conversely, you can speed up the search when using server-side processing by reducing the default of 400mS to instant (0). As with many other parts of DataTables, it is up to yourself how you configure it to suit your needs! The value given for searchDelay is an integer in milliseconds (mS). When given as null DataTables will automatically assign a value that is suitable for the processing mode that the DataTable is operating in: Instant - client-side processing 400mS - server-side processing.
        /*"tabIndex": 0,*/      //Tab index control for keyboard navigation. By default DataTables allows keyboard navigation of the table (sorting, paging, and filtering) by adding a tabindex attribute to the required elements. This allows the end user to tab through the controls and press the enter key to activate them, allowing the table controls to be accessible without a mouse. The default tabindex is 0, meaning that the tab follows the flow of the document. You can overrule this using this parameter if you wish. Use a value of -1 to disable built-in keyboard navigation, although this is not recommended for accessibility reasons.

        /*columnDefs: [   //https://datatables.net/reference/option/columnDefs                classes columns for css in nweb view, but not print.        Very similar to columns, this parameter allows you to assign specific options to columns in the table, although in this case the column options defined can be applied to one or more columns. Additionally, not every column need be specified, unlike columns. This parameter is an array of column definition objects, where the options available exactly match those for columns (see below for list of options in the related links). In addition to the column property options, columnDefs requires a targets property to be set in each definition object (columnDefs.targets). This targets property tells DataTables which column(s) the definition should be applied to.
      { className: "col1",  "targets": [0],     "visible": true,    "searchable": true},
      { className: "col2",  "targets": [1],     "visible": false,   "searchable": false},
      { className: "col3",  "targets": [2],     "visible": true,    "searchable": false },
